A collection of scripts for dealing with video and GIFs. 

This is a work in progress. I've been iterating on these little scripts for my personal purposes, and thought I'd make them available for others to use. Sorry if the documentation is sparse and if things don't work as expected.

Feel free to contribute and make suggestions.
