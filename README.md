A collection of scripts for dealing with video and GIF files. 

These will eventually form the basis for an overarching app ([VideoLord](https://github.com/milojennings/VideoLord)) that provides a suite of functionality that allows easy manipulation of video, clip extraction, GIF creation, bookmarking, deep link sharing, etc...

This is a work in progress. I've been iterating on these little scripts for my personal purposes, and thought I'd make them available for others to use. Sorry if the documentation is sparse and if things don't work as expected.

Feel free to contribute and make suggestions.
